# Learning BERT

In this project I learn to build the BERT model from scratch using PyTorch. The project contains 3 main parts:

- `p1_env` - Part `I` - data source or experience source for the model. In case of the data-driven project, this file prepare the datasets for a model. In case of experience-driven projects, such as RL, this file contains the environment of the world we want to learn from.
- `p2_model` - Part `II` - this file contains the model we want to train, e.g. a PyTorch model.
- `p3_training` - Part `III` - this file contains the main training function logic.

Other parts of the project:

- `p4_model_test` - Part `IV` - tests the model on some unseen data / example run of the model.
- `data` folder - contains the necessary data for training.

## Part I - Prepare the Data


## Part II - Prepare the Model


## Part III - Training


## Part IV - Test the Trained Model
